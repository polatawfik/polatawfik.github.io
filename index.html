                    <p>My name is Pola Tawfik, and I was born and raised in Egypt. After spending the first 13 years of my life there, my family 
                        and I moved to Iowa in 2018. My younger brother is a sophomore at Valley High School, while my 
                        older brother is a student at Iowa State University, working on a degree in electrical engineering. 
                        My brothers and I   had trouble with the English language at first. In 2019, I started working at a restaurant, 
                        which helped me advance my language abilities more quickly. My English proficiency considerably increased as a 
                        result of my diligence and hard work, and I was able to handle a more difficult curriculum 
                        when I started high school.</p>
